This is the Learning of my react.js . I will made projects of react for better learning of react
I am following the series of chai aur code

Their is two way to create react app => npx and npm ,
npx stands for node pacakage executer and npm is node pacakge manager 
while creating through npx create-react-app (<= this is a utility) "name of the project" create-react-app is a bulky utility
that's why it slow down the process of downloading , and install the dependencies which is not needed 
So better way is to create with vite or parcel they are comparatively faster than creat-react-app
