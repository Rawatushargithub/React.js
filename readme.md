This is the Learning of my react.js . I will made projects of react for better learning of react
I am following the series of chai aur code

Their is two way to create react app => npx and npm ,
npx stands for node pacakage executer and npm is node pacakge manager 
while creating through npx create-react-app (<= this is a utility) "name of the project" create-react-app is a bulky utility
that's why it slow down the process of downloading , and install the dependencies which is not needed 
So better way is to create with vite or parcel they are comparatively faster than creat-react-app 

=> React can create it's own DOM which then compare the web DOM and do the changes in web DOM as required

=> React scripts is responsbile for loading the javascript in index.html

=> Best practice is to make the components in upper case and compulsory in  vite react 

=> jsx want to return only one elements 
   whether you are making the app through vite and react always make the name of components function in capital
